MindRDR
=======

MindRDR is an application for Google Glass that uses a mind reader to take and post photos on social networks (Twitter). MindRDR was developed by This Place - http://www.thisplace.com as a piece of R&D into the emerging areas of mind readers and wearables. You can read more about MindRDR here: http://mindrdr.thisplace.com 

If you want to get in touch for whatever reason email mindrdr@thisplace.com

MindRDR will be added to the repo this coming Thursday 10th July once we've added the functionality to link directly to users' Twitter accounts via the oauth qrcode route!
