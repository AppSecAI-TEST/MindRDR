MindRDR
=======

MindRDR is an application for Google Glass that uses a mind reader to take and post photos on social networks (Twitter). MindRDR was developed by This Place - http://www.thisplace.com as a piece of R&D into the emerging areas of mind readers and wearables. You can read more about MindRDR here: http://mindrdr.thisplace.com 

If you want to get in touch for whatever reason email mindrdr@thisplace.com

If you want to compile and use this code you'll need:

* Google Glass
* MindWave Mobile device
* A Twitter dev account to add app key/secret + consumer key/secret

This code is only meant for reference purposes at the moment. It relies on Twitter application settings, web services and bespoke UI.

## Note

MindRDR has been built just for Glass at the moment, therefore view logic is fixed dimension with no rotation handled.

Error handling in general is minimal effort.

There are webservice dependencies that could change.

If you have the right hardware and you want to use the app then we'll be making available a compiled version with Twitter linking outside of GitHub soon.
